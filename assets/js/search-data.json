The primitive data types in Java are: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double. For each primitive data type, Java provides a wrapper class that allows the data to be represented as objects. The corresponding wrapper classes are: Boolean, Byte, Character, Short, Integer, Long, Float, and Double. The output is key to formatting and combining data .",
