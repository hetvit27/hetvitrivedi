# Introduction

This is the page where I will keep track of my tasks for the week and also note the problems/solutions I encounter

# Problems I faced

Computer Science is all about learning from errors and developing innovations. Here are some of the problems I've faced in my computer science journey:
-Week One: I had trouble figuring out why my primitive code for potential energy wasn't actually solving for the value.

# Solutions to the problems

While problems are a must in life, solutions are also just a step away. For the problems I faced while coding, here are the solutions I pondered:
-Week One Solution: I had to figure out the difference between static and non-static variables for it to actually compute the answer
# Reflection

-Week One Reflection: I really liked using Code.org because I felt like it established the basics that were necessary. I liked building my fastpages more to be personalized and for other classes like AP Gov.
