<p>From Ms. Beveridge, I realized that I don't need to be 100% determined on what I want to do in the future. Currently, I want to be a biomedical engineer but it's okay if I decide that that's not my cup of tea later on. She inspired me to be open to exploring new fields and being okay with exploring what I may not find interesting right now because I will never know until I try. I find it super cool that within one company like Qualcommn or ThermoFischer, there are multiple levels and groups of people that are needed to make the company progress. For example, ThermoFischer is a biotechnology company. However, the company has research scientists, marketing teams, biomedical engineers, software engineers, and more. Even if I go into a company as a biomedical engineer, I can always learn the more software/computer science aspect or even dabble into research. Overall, Ms. Beveridge proved the value of expanding your horizons and using your energy to maximize your impact on the world.</p>
<p>From Mr. Porter, I learned the value of being able to keep trying. He failed his first computer science class but never gave up. As he retook it, he started to learn more. Even though he had a break from programming for 8 years, he still ended up finding his way back to it and gained experience in different companies. This made me realize that even if I don't like something at the moment, I should be open to coming back to it. It also teaches me to always prioritize learning. Grades and scores are important but so is walking away from a class/job with more knowledge than you came in with. On a side note, Mr. Porter's interest in being a DevOps and working on deployment is very important. Without DevOps Engineers, it's hard to keep sites secure.</p>
