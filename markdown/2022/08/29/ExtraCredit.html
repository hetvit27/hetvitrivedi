<ul>
  <li>They experimented through other organization i.e. clubs and jobs</li>
  <li>Had a niche for problem solving</li>
  <li>Took time to explore and reflect on skills</li>
  <li>Recognized necessity of programming in different careers and also know how to logically think</li>
  <li>Applied programming to the real world to see benefits</li>
  <li>Worked on specific projects</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#whats-the-biggest-challenge-youve-encountered" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What’s the biggest challenge you’ve encountered?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Coding errors: persist through it and make sure to use google or ask for help</li>
  <li>Combatting egos: focus on your own path and don’t dispute with people; it’s not worth it</li>
  <li>Learn the theory: knowing the basics is necessary so that you can go above and beyond with projects</li>
  <li>Finding motivation: Need to find courage to learn material; application of CS to projects was motivating</li>
  <li>Not everything is just a box to check off; focus on the learning</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Use CS in MATLAB for if and then statement, optimization, and to make tasks faster</li>
  <li>Useful to know how to code for internships or statistical testing</li>
  <li>Used in really all fields and a good skill to have in your back pocket</li>
</ul>

<p>I never realized how useful the skill of programming can be in daily life and in almost all fields. I think it’s very interesting to hear how coding is almost foundational to many STEM majors and can help you go above and beyond in your projects and how you approach real-world problems and solutions. As someone interested in biotechnology and bioengineering, I know that coding will come up in multiple aspects of my career so I really hope to learn as much as I can through CSA as Mr. M and my peers are there to help me whenever I struggle. I’m even more excited to work on more PBL and get to work with real-world problems. I genuinely believe that when you can apply and teach someone else what you learn, you take a step towards mastery. That my ultimate goal in CSA this year. These panelists are who I envision to be - people who have taken what they’ve learned in the classroom and creatively crafted working, tangible projects that showcase their abilities. I’m looking forward to future opportunities.</p>
