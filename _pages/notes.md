# Unit One: Primitive Types
Goal: To learn the fundamentals of Java and other foundational concepts for coding.

Fastpages Notes
_notebooks: mostly jupyter files. This allows building block of markdown, python, java, javascript into a jupyter notebook.
_posts: markdown .md files. This supports frontend web design with markdown, html, and javascript.
_word: word .docx files. This allows you to save Microsoft or Google documents into a docx format. Saving these directly to _word folder will help streamline steps.

Homepage notes
The Home page is sourced by the index.html file. This is the file to personalize and customize your Fastpages home page. BTW, index.html is the standard name for your web sites landing page. 

Primitive Notes
The primitive data types in Java are: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double. For each primitive data type, Java provides a wrapper class that allows the data to be represented as objects. The corresponding wrapper classes are: Boolean, Byte, Character, Short, Integer, Long, Float, and Double. 
The output is key to formatting and combining data
Wrapper Classes are non-primitive data type that do not require declaration. Collegeboard provides the example of String -- they are capitalized unlike primitives

# Unit Two: Using Objects
Goal: Explore reference data in order to represent real-world objects in a digital world and discover methods to initiate more complex operations

# Unit Three: Boolean Expressions and if Statements
Goal: Dive into the building blocks of algorithms and use conditional statements to solve problems and have control over your results

# Unit Four: Iteration
Goal: Learn about iteration which is used for repetition in algorithms

# Unit Five: Writing Clauses
Goal: Explore real-world interactions that can be expressed through code by organizing behaviors and attribites into classes -- also learn about the legal and ethical implications of programming

# Unit Six: Array
Goal: Learn techniques and standard algorithms to work with collections of data structures

# Unit Seven: ArrayList
Goal: Delve into data setts, exploring ArrayList objects for larger amounts of data, as well as the privacy concerns for your personal data storage

# Unit Eight: 2D Array
Goal: Experiment with data sets represented in a table

# Unit Nine: Inheritance
Goal: Manipulate programming without altering original code by using subclasses to create a hierarchy

# Unit Ten: Recurision
Goal: Solve larger problems by solving small versions of the same problems using recursive methods
