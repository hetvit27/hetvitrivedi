# Fastpages Notes
_notebooks: mostly jupyter files. This allows building block of markdown, python, java, javascript into a jupyter notebook.
_posts: markdown .md files. This supports frontend web design with markdown, html, and javascript.
_word: word .docx files. This allows you to save Microsoft or Google documents into a docx format. Saving these directly to _word folder will help streamline steps.

# Homepage notes
The Home page is sourced by the index.html file. This is the file to personalize and customize your Fastpages home page. BTW, index.html is the standard name for your web sites landing page. 

# Primitive Notes
The primitive data types in Java are: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double. For each primitive data type, Java provides a wrapper class that allows the data to be represented as objects. The corresponding wrapper classes are: Boolean, Byte, Character, Short, Integer, Long, Float, and Double. 
The output is key to formatting and combining data
