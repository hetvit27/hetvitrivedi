    "The test took me roughly an hour to complete. I had to guess on some of the questions and reference google and different websites. I definitely am rusty on multiple choice after not practicing it for a long time. I feel like we spent a lot of time on FRQ review so far this trimester that I'll perform better on that section of the test. I feel as though I did better on the recursion problems though which was a concept I struggled with on the test we took at the end of Trimester 1."
