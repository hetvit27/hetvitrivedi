    " My team began working on our reunion project using the Leuck template. We had to deploy our backend on hetvitrivedi.tk but I faced many problems.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Needed to change Java version in pom.xml file because it needs to be synched with computer properties and what Java version is running. Also remove line 101 in pom.xml file <version> 3.30.01 </version>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Needed to add port: 8085 in application.properties because it must match deployment. In the Dockerfile and docker-compose-yml, the port is 8085 and it impacts how it loads the application on localhost. \n",
    " \n",
    "    SEE IMAGE 2\n",
    " - Need to clarify ports and keep them consistent\n",
    " - In application.properties file need to have \"server.port: 8085\" based on what you are exposing\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Faced curl problem that output the Connection reset by peer \n",
    " \n",
    "    SEE IMAGE 3\n",
    " - This problem had to do with two things: my initial 8199 port was already being used by another group; the ports weren't in sync. 8129 was running for local host but 8085 needed to be exposed (see number 2)\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Created faulty nighthawk file that caused nginx to fail\n",
    "\n",
    "    SEE IMAGE 1\n",
    " - Need to cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled\n",
    " - Sudo rm the faulty file\n",
