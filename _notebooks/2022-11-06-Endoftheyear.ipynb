    "Coming into AP CSA with absolutely no background did make the beginning of the year a little difficult. I remember feeling confused and unsure about a lot of concepts my classmates already knew. However, I soon started finding my rhythm. I began feeling more comfortable asking for help to Mr. M and my peers. I felt like the lessons were important for me to learn and apply the material. I learned the importance of practical application and creating tangible projects. My favorite activity of the year was defining the N@TM project because it was cool to see the intersection of code and Physics."
